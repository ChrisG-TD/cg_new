_Films and Games to Which Iâ€™ve Contributed_


I've spent my career at **the intersection of art and technology**, building the systems that let stories scale. I started in visual effects, moved into games, returned to VFX, and ultimately found my home in **feature animation**. Each step added a new layer: solving problems at scale, experimenting with real-time systems, and designing the pipelines that keep productions moving.

At **Walt Disney Animation Studios**, **Weta Digital**, **Sony Pictures Imageworks**, **Digital Domain**, and **EA**, I helped shape productions that pushed the industry forward. From *Tangled* and *Frozen* to *Zootopia* and *Moana*, my focus has always been the same: **merge artistic vision with technical precision** so every frame resonates.

As **Chair of one of the world's top animation programs**, I carried that mission into education. I built a student-run studio, produced original films, and mentored the next wave of artists and technologists who are now shaping the industry themselves.

> **Today, I've expanded my focus to include AI.** Not as a novelty, but as the next evolution of the same work: designing workflows where technology empowers artists instead of replacing them. By fusing AI with proven production pipelines, I'm exploring new ways to cut friction, boost creativity, and unlock stories we couldn't tell before.

**The throughline is simple:** I build bridges between imagination and execution. Whether it's a film pipeline, a game system, or an AI-driven workflow, my goal is the same: *make tools invisible so creators can focus on story*.
