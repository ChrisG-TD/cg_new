_Films and Games to Which I’ve Contributed_

My journey has always been driven by a deep passion for storytelling and the boundless potential of technology. I began as someone who wanted to bring characters to life, to see emotion, movement, and story leap off the page. That spark led me from animation into visual effects, game development, and ultimately into building the pipelines and tools that help stories thrive at scale.

Over the years, my work at Walt Disney Animation Studios, Weta Digital, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Digital Domain, and EA has been shaped by a dual focus: merging creativity with innovation. From crafting breathtaking animation and visual effects to developing workflows that powered Tangled, Frozen, Zootopia, and Moana, I’ve sought to blend technical precision with artistic vision so every creation resonates with its audience.

As Chair of a top-ranked animation program, I extended this mission to education. I founded a student-run studio, produced original films, and mentored the next generation of artists and technologists.

Today, I’m exploring the frontier that excites me most: AI prompt design and engineering. By leveraging AI-assisted tools and artist-centered workflows, I aim to empower myself and others, both artists and technologists, to push boundaries and reimagine what’s possible.

Looking ahead, the future remains an open canvas. With the same curiosity and drive that have fueled my journey, I’ll continue pushing stories forward and inspiring creators to embrace both art and technology in their own unique ways.
