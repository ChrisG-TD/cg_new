*AI helped shape the words here, but the ideas, experiments, and code are 100% human-made. This is part 2 of a series on prompt engineering—turning intuition into engineering.*


Prompt engineering isn’t just about writing one clever instruction. The early chaos I described came from treating every prompt as if it lived in the same category. They don’t. A zero-shot sanity check is not a ReAct pipeline. A ToT exploration is not a meta-prompt that spawns its own instructions. Without categories and behaviors, evaluation collapses.

In this section, I document the structured prompt types that formed the backbone of my evaluation framework. Each type was defined not only by name but by **testable behavior**, tagged with metadata, and evaluated under controlled runs.

## Zero-shot Prompting: The Baseline

Zero-shot prompts are the control group—one instruction, no context, no examples. They reveal the raw tendencies of a model with no scaffolding.

**Metadata fields**

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `taskType` | classification • generation • reasoning |
| `expectedOutputFormat` | freeform • structured |
| `ambiguityRisk` | high • medium • low |


> 💡 **Why it matters:** Zero-shot reveals how a model “thinks” with no support.  
> ⚠️ **Failure highlight:** Models frequently produced fabricated citations (“papers that didn’t exist”), an instant indicator of drift.  



---

## One-shot and Few-shot Prompting: Teaching via Pattern

One-shot prompts provide a single input/output demonstration. Few-shot scales to 2–5. They operate like mini-datasets embedded in text, teaching the model via analogy.

**Metadata fields**

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `exampleCount` | 1 for one-shot • 2–5 for few-shot |
| `patternType` | classification • transformation • generation |
| `alignmentScore` | % completions matching example pattern |

> 💡 **Why it matters:** Few-shot is the bridge from raw instruction to structured learning.  
> ⚠️ **Failure highlight:** Reusing classification examples from one dataset in another caused misclassifications—evidence of rapid overfitting.  

---

## System, Role, and Contextual Prompting: Structural Scaffolding

Between examples and reasoning sits **structural prompting**.  

- **System prompting** sets global rules (e.g., “always output JSON”).  
- **Role prompting** assigns a persona (e.g., “act as a safety auditor”).  
- **Contextual prompting** injects situational details (e.g., “you are writing for a retro gaming blog”).  

**Metadata fields**

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `systemRule` | format • tone • safety |
| `rolePersona` | teacher • developer • critic |
| `contextWindow` | topical background included |

> 💡 **Why it matters:** These scaffolds set the frame before reasoning begins.  
> ⚠️ **Failure highlight:** Role prompting often bled style into precision tasks—e.g., “humorous” responses when exact numbers were required.  

---

## Step-back Prompting: Zoom Out Before Solving

Step-back prompting forces the model to answer a broader framing question before narrowing down. This technique activates background knowledge before execution.

**Metadata fields**

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `stepBackScope` | general principle • category • analogy |
| `integrationMode` | prepend • append • contextual insert |

> 💡 **Why it matters:** Improves reasoning by priming the model with abstractions.  
> ⚠️ **Failure highlight:** Overly vague step-backs (“think generally about science”) led to irrelevant digressions.  

---

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Linear Reasoning

CoT prompts require the model to “think out loud.” Multi-step reasoning makes intermediate logic visible, allowing error tracing.

**Metadata fields**

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `stepCount` | number of reasoning steps |
| `errorCascadeFlag` | did one wrong step collapse the sequence? |
| `completionTrimmed` | yes/no (cut off by token limit) |

> 💡 **Why it matters:** Exposes where reasoning breaks.  
> ⚠️ **Failure highlight:** If the first step was wrong, every step after collapsed—classic cascade failure.  

---

## Self-consistency: Voting Across Reasoning Paths

Where CoT follows one chain, self-consistency generates many, then aggregates the majority answer. It’s expensive but stabilizes outputs.

**Metadata fields**

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `sampleCount` | number of runs |
| `voteDistribution` | counts per answer |
| `consensusStrength` | percent agreement |

> 💡 **Why it matters:** Converts brittle reasoning into a distribution.  
> ⚠️ **Failure highlight:** On ambiguous tasks, models split evenly, producing a “coin-flip consensus.”  

---

## Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT): Branch, Evaluate, Prune

ToT generalizes CoT by encouraging multiple reasoning paths before selection.

**Metadata fields**

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `branchCount` | number of paths |
| `evaluationMode` | self-judged • guided • random |
| `outputShape` | single winner • ranked list • ensemble merge |

> 💡 **Why it matters:** Enables exploration of alternatives before committing.  
> ⚠️ **Failure highlight:** Without pruning rules, models confidently picked the weakest branch—convincing but wrong.  

---

## ReAct: Reasoning + Acting with Tools

ReAct merges reasoning with tool invocation—simulating agent workflows (“think, then act”).

**Metadata fields**

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `toolSet` | calculator • search • parser • API |
| `toolInvocationCount` | number of tool calls |
| `toolAccuracy` | percent correct invocations |

> 💡 **Why it matters:** Bridges natural language reasoning with external systems.  
> ⚠️ **Failure highlight:** Models hallucinated nonexistent tools (“sentimentAPI()”), breaking the workflow.  

---

## Meta Prompting: Prompts That Generate Prompts

Meta prompts ask models to generate new instructions, adapt weak ones, or translate prompts across domains.

**Metadata fields**

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `promptFluency` | clarity and completeness |
| `constraintRetention` | presence of required constraints |
| `transferabilityScore` | success across domains |

> 💡 **Why it matters:** Unlocks recursive adaptation of instructions.  
> ⚠️ **Failure highlight:** Meta-generated prompts often looked polished but dropped critical constraints—elegant but useless.  

---

## Why This Matters

Each type isn’t just a style—it’s a **failure mode in disguise**:  

- Zero-shot → ambiguity  
- Few-shot → overfitting  
- System/role/contextual → style bleed  
- Step-back → vague abstraction drift  
- CoT → error cascades  
- Self-consistency → averaged ambiguity  
- ToT → bad-branch confidence  
- ReAct → tool hallucinations  
- Meta → polished but broken scaffolds  

By formalizing prompt types as **classes of tests with metadata schemas**, I transformed ad-hoc tricks into **versionable, explainable, testable assets**. This structure is the only way to evaluate prompt performance at scale.  

> ✅ Structured prompts → reproducible evaluations  
> ✅ Metadata → measurable behaviors  
> ✅ Classes of tests → predictable breakdowns  

In the next section, I move from defining structured prompt types to the mindset and mechanics of testing them: how prompts become reproducible evaluation cases, how failure is designed on purpose, and how YAML metadata turns each prompt into a benchmarkable test vector.
