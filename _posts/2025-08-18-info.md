Over the years, I’ve tried just about every system to capture my ideas. At this point, almost everything has been consolidated into either Google Drive or Obsidian. Now I’m going back through it all, refactoring and reshaping those scattered notes into something more structured: posts and connected thoughts.

My goal is to keep them clear, accessible, and tied to the right context. Whenever possible, I’ll backdate them to reflect the actual time and place when those ideas first surfaced. That way, the archive won’t just be a dump of notes, but a timeline of how my thinking and projects have evolved.
