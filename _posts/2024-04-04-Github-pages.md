# Why I Chose GitHub Pages to Consolidate My Ideas

Over the years, I’ve scattered my thoughts, experiments, and projects across so many platforms it would make your head spin:  

- Blogger  
- Tumblr  
- Medium  
- Ghost  
- WordPress  

Each platform had its moment, but none of them really stuck. They felt like borrowed apartments rather than my own house. And the problem with rented spaces is simple: sooner or later, you outgrow them, they change the rules, or they lock you out.  

So here I am, consolidating everything under one roof, **my** roof, hosted on GitHub Pages.  

## Why consolidate?

Because my creative and technical journey has *always* been about finding ways to capture, shape, and share ideas. But it’s easy to lose track when those ideas live in a hundred different places. Over the years, my workflow included:  

- **Notebooks**: shelves full of handwritten notes, sketchbooks, and margins scribbled with pipelines, lecture plans, story beats, or random breakthroughs at 2 a.m.  
- **Roam Research**: a promising graph-based knowledge system, but it left me worried about lock-in and portability.  
- **Obsidian**: my current day-to-day knowledge base, solid and local-first with powerful linking ,  but I’m using it *for now* until something better comes along, since the publishing workflow still feels incomplete.  
- **Bear**: beautifully designed, but stuck in the Apple ecosystem ,  I wanted platform independence.  
- **Jira**: useful for production pipelines, issue tracking, and team collaboration, but overkill for personal knowledge management.  

All of these tools had strengths. But they also had friction:  

- Sync challenges  
- Vendor lock-in  
- Limited version control  
- Closed or proprietary formats  
- High overhead just to publish ideas  

## Why GitHub Pages?

Because it brings together what *all* those tools taught me about knowledge and storytelling, and fixes their biggest weaknesses:  

✅ **Open** ,  Markdown, plain text, universally readable, no walled garden  
✅ **Versioned** ,  I can track every change, rollback, branch, and evolve ideas just like code  
✅ **Free** ,  no subscriptions, no vendor fees  
✅ **Under my name** ,  I own the domain, the repo, the content  
✅ **Simple** ,  a Jekyll site built on Markdown, with the Git history behind it  
✅ **Futureproof** ,  Git is not going anywhere  

GitHub Pages is where I get to *own my own destiny*.  

## How this fits my journey

For decades, I’ve been building creative pipelines ,  at Disney, Weta, Imageworks, EA, Digital Domain ,  where version control, clarity, and reproducibility are non-negotiable. Pipelines don’t exist without *trust* in how data flows.  

That’s the mindset I’m bringing to my personal archive.  

I’m treating my own writing, experiments, breakdowns, and reflections the same way I treated multi-million-dollar animated assets and shot data ,  with intention, organization, and a permanent record.  

In a sense, GitHub Pages is my “personal production pipeline.”  

## The final consolidation

I’m rolling everything up here:  

- My writing  
- My code  
- My pipelines  
- My thoughts on AI  
- My sketches and explorations  
- My technical breakdowns  

No more link rot. No more ephemeral blogging platforms changing their monetization models or breaking old posts.  

This is my digital home.  

**One roof. My roof.**  

And if I want to pack up and move again someday? The entire house comes with me, thanks to plain text and Git.  

That’s why I chose GitHub Pages.
