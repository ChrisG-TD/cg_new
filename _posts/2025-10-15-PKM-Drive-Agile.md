### Setting the Stage

If you know me, you know I love PKM.
I’ve been using it for years, testing new tools, building custom systems, and constantly pushing myself to learn new ways of thinking and working. On top of that, I love sharing it with others. Over the years, I’ve taught classes and led workshops in all kinds of environments, from animation and VFX studios to executive strategy meetings.

This reflection is one of those lessons I keep coming back to. It’s not about note-taking or productivity hacks, it’s about how PKM can reshape the way we lead teams, manage complexity, and drive progress. It’s a different angle on a topic I’ve written about before, but still one of my favorites because it keeps me sharp and curious.

That’s where **PKM**, personal knowledge management, becomes more than a way to capture ideas. It becomes your *thinking layer*, the system that drives agile from the inside out.

### 1. Frame Before You Build

The real leverage in PM and TPM work isn’t execution, it’s **framing**.
Before creating tickets or tasks, capture a **situation statement** in your PKM:

> What’s happening, why does it matter, and what’s getting in the way?

Follow it with a **core question**:
> “How might we…” ,the phrase that forces exploration before solutioning.

Pair that with a quick root-cause analysis (5 Whys or fishbone).
Framing before doing is the difference between building fast and building right.

---

### 2. Build an Idea Graph, Not an Idea Pile

Ideas don’t start as projects, they start as loose connections, stray observations, or notes from a hallway conversation.

In your PKM, treat every idea as a node in a **living graph**.
Link ideas to the context they came from, meetings, documents, or personal insights.
Let them cross-pollinate through tags and backlinks until patterns emerge.

When an idea matures, promote it into a project, but keep the original context connected. That’s how you maintain a lineage of thought, why the idea mattered in the first place.

---

### 3. Turn Notes Into Stories

Every project, feature, or sprint item should live as a linked page inside your PKM, complete with origin, reasoning, and dependencies.

Each story connects to:
- Its **problem statement**
- Relevant **decisions or constraints**
- The **stakeholders** or owners
- Any **dependencies** or upstream blockers

Now your PKM doubles as a **story graph**. You can run queries like:
> “Show all projects missing a defined problem”
> “List tasks linked to open decisions”

It’s backlog intelligence, not just task management.

---

### 4. Run Agile Ceremonies Inside Your PKM

Your PKM can run the full agile rhythm:

- **Daily standups**: A daily note template with “yesterday, today, blockers.”
- **Sprint planning**: Query all stories tagged `#ready` and pull them into scope.
- **Retrospectives**: Weekly pages linking to notes tagged `#lessonLearned` or `#fix`.
- **Demos**: Dedicated pages with outputs, feedback, and next iteration plans.

This isn’t duplication of Jira, it’s the *contextual layer* above it.
The place where the *why* lives.

---

### 5. Evolve the System Like a Product

Don’t build a perfect template day one.
Start light:
- A page template for `#idea`
- A story template for `#feature`
- A tag set: `#idea`, `#ready`, `#doing`, `#done`

Then layer in queries, dashboards, and automation as you go.
Treat your PKM as a product, iterated, tested, and improved through sprints.
Your process evolves just like your projects do.

---

### 6. Surface the Hidden Work

Every team has invisible work, the background conversations, one-off experiments, and side fixes that never make it to the backlog.

A PKM can reveal it:
- Query orphaned notes (ideas not yet prioritized)
- Find pages that reference “decision” without a resolution
- Tag insights that emerged mid-project and fold them back into planning

This closes feedback loops and keeps your team’s actual effort visible.

---

### 7. Pair PKM with Your Execution Tools

Your PKM is the **upstream layer**; Jira, Linear, or Asana handle downstream execution.

Use the PKM for framing, ideation, and decision tracking, everything that happens before a ticket exists.
Once something is ready, export it downstream with a short link back to its origin page.
Now every item has traceability, from initial spark to shipped deliverable.

---

### 8. Make Thinking Visible

The highest value of PKM-driven agile is **transparency**.
Stakeholders can trace decisions, see reasoning, and understand tradeoffs.
Instead of status updates, you’re providing *context flow*, the logic behind progress.

When your thinking is visible, you lead with clarity, not control.
Teams align faster. Projects stay grounded. Trust compounds.

---

### Final Thoughts

Agile isn’t about speed, it’s about *learning loops*.
PKM turns those loops into a system: capture, connect, reflect, and act.

So next time someone says, “Let’s add it to the backlog,” try this instead:
> “Let’s frame it first.”

Once you start managing ideas like code, linked, versioned, iterative, you’ll wonder how you ever worked without it.
