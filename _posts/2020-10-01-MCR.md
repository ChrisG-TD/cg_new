### Looking Back on the Massive Curriculum Rewrite  
*relection Fall 2020*

As we’re just starting to see the fruits of the **Massive curriculum rewrite**, I can’t help but look back at the skills I’ve honed over the past few years. I’d definitely call them **Program Management skills**, the kind I first developed at **Walt Disney Animation Studios**.  

If I didn’t have those tools, **Agile, Scrum, Waterfall thinking, resource planning, vendor management, and risk mitigation**, I know for a fact this project would have crashed and burned.  

The rewrite pushed every bit of my coordination and leadership ability: managing multiple sites, aligning faculty teams, forecasting multi-million-dollar budgets, and constantly adjusting milestones while keeping the big picture intact.  

I love pushing myself to use these skills in different ways. Whether it’s **building production pipelines** or **architecting academic programs**, the same principles apply, clarity, accountability, and execution through structure.

*Note- While this was only posted recently, I’ve been going through my old notes and this one stuck with me. It perfectly captures a moment when I first started realizing how much of my technical background had quietly evolved into real program management.*
