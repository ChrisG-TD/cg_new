# The Shape-Shifting Role of the TD, the TA, and Now the understanding AI

This isn’t about job titles. It’s about a mindset. A way of thinking that has followed me through every part of my career, from animation pipelines to VFX firefighting to academia and now leaning into AI.

If you’ve ever been called a Technical Director or a Technical Artist, you know the real job isn’t in the title. It’s in the way you move through a problem. You see something that’s broken or slow or unclear, and you fix it. You write the script, build the tool, or talk to the right person. You create clarity where there was friction.

And more often than not, you’re doing it behind the scenes, one step ahead of the artist hitting a wall.

That mindset hasn’t changed. But the terrain has.

## Where It Started

When I began in animation and VFX, TDs were the quiet architects of production. We wrote first in MEL then Python tools, stitched together pipelines, and patched up chaos. We didn’t chase credit. We chased flow.

A TD knew how to build systems that kept animators animating, lighters lighting, and render farms from catching fire. There was pride in that invisibility. The best tool was the one nobody noticed because it just worked.

As production evolved, the needs changed. The work moved closer to real time. Engines like Unreal and Unity became part of the pipeline. Artists were no longer handing things off down a linear track. Everything was iterative, collaborative, fast.

So the role evolved.

## Enter the Technical Artist

In games and interactive content, the TD role morphed into something more embedded. Technical Artists emerged as hybrid creatures. Part shader wizard, part rigging expert, part performance optimizer. You might be tuning an animation blueprint at noon, solving export bugs at two, and rewriting a tool UI at four.

The idea is the same: enable the artist. But now the language had changed. Nodes along with code. Real-time and frame rate instead of render queues. The demands had shifted toward visual fidelity, user experience, and speed of iteration.

We started becoming system thinkers without even realizing it.

And as the tools matured, so did we.

## Then AI Walked In

Not with a bang. With a whisper. First, it was just text completion or image generation. Then it was helping write code. Then it was building tools that felt like co-creators.

At first, it looked like something new. Something foreign. But it felt familiar.

Why? Because building with AI uses the same muscle we’ve always relied on. It’s the same loop: listen to the artist, understand the workflow, identify the friction, build the bridge.

Only now, that bridge might involve a language model, a diffusion system, or a vector database.

The AI developer is not some completely new creature. It’s a TD or TA who has picked up new tools.

Prompt design feels like debugging a conversation. Fine-tuning a model feels like calibrating a rig. Injecting AI into a creative pipeline is just the next logical step in tool building.

We are not moving away from what we know. We’re expanding it.

## A Shift in Philosophy

When I think about the best TDs I’ve worked with, none of them bragged about the complexity of their tools. They bragged about how fast their artists could work. Or how few bugs they got. Or how something that used to take four days now takes four hours.

Being good technically isn’t enough. The real craft is knowing when to hide the tech, when to make something simpler, when to stay out of the way.

AI forces you to think like that all the time.

It’s not about showing off a smart model. It’s about whether it saves someone time. Whether it unlocks something that felt stuck before. Whether it makes the work feel fun again.

This is the deeper connection I see. The best AI developers are going to be the ones who think like TDs and TAs. Not because they can train a model or hook up a fancy API, but because they understand how creative work flows. And how it breaks. And how to quietly fix it without slowing anyone down.

## Looking Forward

I’m not interested in building AI tools that replace artists. I’m interested in building ones that make them faster, freer, more playful.

The same way we wrote auto-rigging tools. The same way we optimized geometry for real-time engines. The same way we cleaned up a simulation that was blowing up frames at render time.

This is all the same story. We’re just adding a new chapter.

So where does that leave us? In a strange, exciting place.

A place where your title might say AI developer, but your instincts come from years of TD and TA work. A place where success is not defined by what you build, but how seamlessly it helps others create. Will there be the role of GenArt TD in some film credit crawl?

We need more people in that space. People who know how to translate between art and tech. People who are okay living in the in-between.

The frontier isn’t about which tool you use. It’s about the quality of the flow you help create.

I’ve lived through multiple revolutions in this industry. From pre-rendered to real-time. From node graphs to code. From script-based rigs to data-driven systems.

This one feels different. Not because it’s harder. But because it’s invisible.

And that makes it even more important to get right.

## Final Thought

If you’ve ever written a tool for an artist, stayed late to fix a broken maya scene, or sat between two departments trying to make them talk to each other, you already understand how to think in systems.

Now we’re just thinking in systems that learn.

The world needs more of that thinking. Not just from engineers. Not just from artists. But from people who live in the middle and make things work.

That’s the job I’m still doing. The title just keeps changing.
