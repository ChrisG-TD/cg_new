*AI helped shape the words here, but the ideas, experiments, and code are **100% human-made**.*

Over the past 6 months, I tested more than **10,000 prompts** across local, web, and API calls to GPT-4, GROK, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, and LLaMA (and a few others). What started as curiosity became a deep investigation into how AI responds, reasons, and delivers results, insights that are already reshaping workflows across creative and technical fields.  

I use **Obsidian** as my research command center. Every high-performing prompt structure, every model-specific quirk, every metric is stored, linked, and visualized in its graph view. The result is a *living map* of model behavior, instruction placement, and token efficiency. This isn’t just a pretty network, it’s an evolving blueprint for smarter prompting and a foundation for AI-assisted productivity across industries.  

### Key findings from the experiment:
- Certain prompt structures improved output consistency by up to **40%**, streamlining repeatable tasks.  
- Reordering instructions reduced token usage by **20–30%**, cutting both time and cost.  
- Each model has a distinct **"personality"** — generic prompts won’t cut it if you want top-tier results.  
- A prompt that succeeds in one model can fail in another — **adaptation is not optional**.  

### What’s coming next in this series:
- **A deep dive into prompt typologies,** from zero-shot baselines to multi-step reasoning frameworks, with full examples and token profiles.
- A breakdown of **cross-model evaluation** showing why the same prompt behaves differently in GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, and LLaMA.
- **Token-aware design strategies** that reduce costs without sacrificing output quality.
- The **QA and verification workflow** I use to avoid “placeholder” prompts and ensure repeatable results.
- A preview of the **agent-driven pipeline** I’m building for dynamic, model-adaptive prompting.

These discoveries have already leveled up my workflows in animation, game design, and AI prototyping, but they’re just as relevant for marketing, ops, and software teams looking to make AI work for them, not the other way around.

What’s your biggest challenge with AI tools right now? Drop it below, I’ll suggest a few prompt strategies from my research that might help.

Full methodology and (possibly) an open-source toolkit coming soon.
